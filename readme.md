# What is this?

This is a theme that stripped most of the wordpress functionality out of a theme and uses only the API and admin CRUD functionality. An example of a custom post type is added together with and example of the rest functions and alteration of the API output.

If you want a full wordpress with the theme and plugins (ACF,slate-admin-theme, thumbnail-regenerate ) and an admin whitewash you can always download that here:

Just clone this into your themes folder of your wordpress instalation.
